HKKTagWriteView
===============

This is an input custom view like Evernote app style tagging.
The major difference is that the view supports only single line of tagging with horizontal scroll.


If you need to support multiple words with single space in a tag, use the following property:

 - allowToUseSingleSpace


Now available for supporting Swift. For more detail, check tagWriteView.swift file out.


Installation
------------
It is available to use CocoaPods for Swift version.
```
pod "TagWriteView"
```

I don't still prepare an podspec for Objective-C version.
